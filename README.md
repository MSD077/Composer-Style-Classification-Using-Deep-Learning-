# Composer Style Classification Using Deep Learning

The goal of the project is to predict which musician has composed the music based on the composition style. We have 6 music composers in our dataset namely Mozart, Schubert, Chopin, Grieg, Haydn, and Mendel. Given a song, our objective is to classify which composer out of these 6 has composed the song. Each composer will have a unique composition style and we have used Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) to capture the essential features of the song. To solve this task, we have built a convolutional neural network (CNN) and used accuracy and F1-score as our evaluation metrics. 

## Dataset: 

The dataset used for the project was sourced from kaggle - https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/wjholst/composer-classification-wav-samples 

The dataset has 9626 songs of 6 different composers namely Mozart, Chopin, Grieg, Schubert, Haydn, Mendel, in the wav (Waveform Audio File) format.

## Requirements file:
This file contains all the necessary packages that needs to be installed before running the code.
